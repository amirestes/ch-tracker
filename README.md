Basic App to track a dog's championship title bench or field.

Enter dog's name.

Click the number of points awarded for the day.
Display current number of points.
Tracks number of majors won.
Confirmation message with 15 points with 2 major wins entered.

Update progress bar with a percentage function to display points progress to championship.

Saves dog's name and current number of points to localStorage and calls them to print.

Originally tried to start as a React.js app, but decided to start over using JavaScript.
Why did I decide to start over? Realized I was overcomplicating it and confusing myself.

Will refactor in React when done.
